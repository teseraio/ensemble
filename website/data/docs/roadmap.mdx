This page describes some of the core ideas that will be developed towards a 1.0 release of Ensemble.
We encourage you to check our Github issue tracker for a more detailed version and priorities.

Ensemble is on his early stages and we want to encourage the community to participate and give as much feedback as possible.

## Parametrization

As with any other complex application, databases have a rich set of configuration parameters that control things
like memory usage, control access, users or security certificates among other things.
While some of these options can be changed dynamically with API calls ([Resources](/docs/specification#resource)), others may require SIGHUP signals
or rolling updates of the nodes in the cluster.

Ensemble will provide common and flexible interfaces to configure all the options in the databases and abstract the user
of any management burden.

## Monitoring

Ensemble should be able to scrape metrics and insights from the databases under his management so that another external sidecar
application is not required.

These metrics will be exported in Prometheus format on the operator server. Another application (i.e. Telegraf) can relay
this information to any other external metrics server.

## Encryption

There is no plan to use the native SSL/TLS communication primitives of the databases to support transit encryption for
two reasons: First, each database has his own configuration for the certificates. Second, it would require custom
implementations to support complex workflows like certificate rotation and hot reloadings.
Thus, Ensemble will rely on external mesh networks like Istio or Consul for transit encryption.

## Databases

There exists three types of database topologies:

- Homogeneous: All the nodes are the same type. Any node can be promoted to primary (i.e. Postgresql, Rabbitmq)
- Heterogeneous: Each node has a distinct function. Usually, one group acts as primaries and another group
as secondaries (i.e. Kubernetes, Spark).
- Mixed: Each node performs multiple tasks. (i.e. Elasticsearch).

Currently, Ensemble only handles homogeneous clusters but our goal is to support all three types including complex
node topologies (i.e. partitions) and multi-cloud deployments.
